# Medical-Image-classification
Use fine-tuned ResNet50 to classify brain tumors. ResNet50 is pre-trained on ImageNet. The fully connected layer of the model is changed. DropOut is used in the fully connected layer to prevent overfitting. In addition, the loss function uses cross entropy, which is added Label Smoothing.
